# CRUDDY
Completed in a 36hr straight period...

This is not as finished as I would have hoped due to a harddrive failure mid project.
However if I had another day to tweak it could be vastly improved and made fully functional.
As well I could certainly deploy it to a live environment.

Also note that there is no protection from html injection what so ever and also writes user input directly to disk,
this is not a great way to have things setup but it was the quickest way to do so without prebuilt database.
