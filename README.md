# CRUDDY
A project for an opportunity.

This is not as finished as I would have hoped due to a harddrive failure mid project.
However if I had another day to tweak it could be vastly improved and made fully functional.

Also note that there is no protection from html injection what so ever and also writes user input directly to disk,
this is not a great way to have things setup but it was the quickest way to do so without prebuilt database.
